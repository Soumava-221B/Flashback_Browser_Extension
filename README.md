# Flashback_Browser_Extension

# 1. Inspiration
In this era of online education, we have gone completely digital from writing our notes to making projects that have been evaluated by our teachers. Hence we also need to find a digital way of tracking our learning and the shortcoming that we face while learning a topic of the subject. At the end of the week, we tend to forget about the tasks or the topics we have learned. Here comes the web-extension flashback which provides you with the necessary tools to manage your leanings on a weekly basis. 

# 2. What it does(problem statement)
A web browser extension for representing your work done on a weekly basis so that you can find your work, stay more productive, and understand your shortcomings in the journey of learning about a new Tech Stack or working on an existing project. It also helps to look back on your previous week's learning and the issues which still need to be resolved.
